<p><b>Redact.js</b> is intended to be a drop-in replacement for React allowing:</p>
<ul>
<li>permanent conversion of a codebase to ES2015</li>
<li>eliminate the need for a build step, for development and other scenarios</li>
<li>provide full interoperability with native Web Components and Web APIs</li>
</ul>

<p>This project came about to encourage using the range of widely supported native Web APIs and features--including devtool instrumentation--as well as foster a better development experience by eliminating superfluous technology, dependencies and abstractions. Specifically use of CSS variables instead of SASS, explicit JavaScript modules instead of bundling, Web Components and highly performant DOM APIs instead of duplicating these concerns. It's worth noting this doesn't exclude the possibility of adding back any of these particular technologies when and where indicated--simply facilitating a modern approach to working with Web technology today and into the future.
</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="./demo/">the demo</a> to compare performance, features and explore the devtool instrumentation first-hand.</p>
